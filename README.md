# redhat-image-mode-actions
## Template repo for Github Actions based builds of bootc images. 
This repository is designed be used with the excercise in the redhat-cop/redhat-image-mode-demo repository. This template provides a sample Containerfile and workflow as a starting point for use in your own account. The workflow can be triggered in two ways, by creating a tag or manually. A manual trigger will set one of the tags to the branch name which may overwrite older manual builds.  For more information on the workflow design, refer to the exercise.

## Workflow variables to be aware of
In the `env` section of the job, the image name is set using the name of the repository. If you would like to use a different name, that can be changed by modifying the following variable:

*IMAGE_NAME: ${{github.event.repository.name}}*

The job is set to use the GitHub container registry as the user who triggered the action. You may need to adjust this to suit your situation. To use a different registry, update this variable and the associated log in step before the push step.

*REGISTRY: ghcr.io/${{ github.actor }}*

As examples, this template sets 3 tags on the image built: latest, the SHA of the commit associated with the workflow, and the tag used to trigger the workflow. Your use case may need different tags, these are set in the `build-image` step:

*tags: latest ${{ github.sha }} ${{ github.ref_name }}*

## Accessing a subscription during build
For RHEL, this example uses an activation key to get access to a subscription and a service account to get access to the terms based registry images. These are set up as secrets and variables scoped to the repo.You can easily change the names of these in the repo and the workflow file to suit your own standards.

To use packages from the RHEL repositories, the GHA runner will need to have subscription information available. This workflow will register the container, execute the build, and then unregister as a final step. You will only be using the subscription for the duration of the build. To use subscription-manager in a pipieline like this, it's easiest to use an activation key. If you don't have a subscription already, the [No-cost RHEL for developers subscription](https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhel/download) is a good option.

If you aren't familiar with actionvation keys, from the docs:
> An activation key is a preshared authentication token that enables authorized users to register and auto-configure systems. Running a registration command with an activation key and organization  ID combination, instead of a username and password combination, increases security and facilitates automation.

[Creating an activation key in the console](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/subscription_central/1-latest/html/getting_started_with_activation_keys_on_the_hybrid_cloud_console/assembly-creating-managing-activation-keys#proc-creating-act-keys-console_)

### Activation key secrets
In this template, the two secrets are defined as:

* *RHT_ORGID* stores the Organization ID
* *RHT_ACT_KEY* stores the Activation key name

## Getting access to the base image
Unlike UBI, the bootc base image does require an account to access since this is a full RHEL host. To log into the registry during a pipeline build or other automation, you can [create a regitry service account](https://access.redhat.com/RegistryAuthentication#registry-service-accounts-for-shared-environments-4) in tne customer portal.

### Token secrets
In this template, the two secrets are defined as:

* *RHT_REG_SVCUSER* stores the token username (has a "|" character in the name)
* *RHT_REG_SVCPASS* stores the token password
